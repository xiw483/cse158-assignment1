This assignment involves using recomender systems and machine learning algorithms to solve ML questions surrounding real datasets.
This assignment consists of two tasks: played prediction and category prediction.
For played prediction, I utilized Jaccard and Cosine similarities to predict whether a given user has played the video game.
For category prediction, I used natural language processing methods to predict the genre of a video game given the reviews.
