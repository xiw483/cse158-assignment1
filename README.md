# cse158-assignment1
Tasks:
You are expected to complete the following tasks:

Play prediction (both classes) Predict given a (user,game) pair from ‘pairs Played.txt’ whether the user
would play the game (0 or 1). Accuracy will be measured in terms of the categorization accuracy (fraction
of correct predictions). The test set has been constructed such that exactly 50% of the pairs correspond
to played games and the other 50% do not.

Category prediction (CSE158 only) Predict the category of a game from a review. Five categories are
used for this task, which can be seen in the baseline program, namely Action, Strategy, RPG, Adventure,
and Sport. Performance will be measured in terms of the fraction of correct classifications.
